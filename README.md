# MasterText

Mastertext is a very much **prealpha** small to medium corpus free form text storage,search, and retrieval engine. It is intended to help in things like mind mapping, time tracking, research, creative writing... Look I'm just building the ultimate organizational tool for people with minds like mine. So if you think having a searchable archive of most of what you've read, over the past five years is a *good* thing congratulations your neurodivergent.


All joking aside this is a tool for creating largish databases of texts to aid in free associative and insight oriented thinking. This program aids the Grammar stage of the classical conception of learning and thinking, by making the accumulation of raw knowledge easy, and creating signposts so that exploration and brainstorming can be quickly brought into focus, and you can produce productive productions prodigiously.The design is such  that the user can flow seemlessly from fishing with this tool into using a mind mapping suite or other tools to quickly structure and outline an idea, then take that outline into a final synthesis.

This is not a product for everyday use yet. It's missing about half a dozen things, it needs to even be considered alpha stage software. Putting on github now so i can start bouncing ideas off of friends.
