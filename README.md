# MasterText

Mastertext is a very much **prealpha** small to medium corpus free form text storage,search, and retrieval engine. It is intended to help in things like mind mapping, time tracking, research, creative writing... Look I'm just building the ultimate organizational tool for people with minds like mine. So if you think having a searchable archive of most of what you've read, over the past five years is a *good* thing congratulations your neurodivergent.
