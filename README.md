# MasterText

Mastertext is a very much **prealpha** small to medium corpus free form text storage,search, and retrieval engine. It is intended to help in things like mind mapping, time tracking, research, creative writing... Look I'm just building the ultimate organizational tool for people with minds like mine. So if you think having a searchable archive of most of what you've read, over the past five years is a *good* thing congratulations your neurodivergent.


All joking aside this tool for creating largish databases of texts to aid in free associative and insight oriented thinking, you can then put reference ids or search quires in a mind mapping suite or something. This program aids the Grammar stage of the classical conception of learning and thinking, by making the accumulation of raw knowledge easy, and creating signposts so that exploration and brainstorming can be quickly brought into focus, and you can produce productive productions prodigiously.

This thing is not ready for public use I'm still deciding on a user interface, and there's not yet  a way to start a new db from scratch yet. But I wanted to get it on github so i could start bouncing ideas off of friends
